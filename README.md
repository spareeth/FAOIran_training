Spatio-temporal analysis using GRASS GIS crash course
=====================================================

This repository was created for a [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/) crash course.

## Software

We will use GRASS GIS 7.8 (current stable version). It can be installed either through standalone installers/binaries or through OSGeo-Live (which includes all OSGeo software and packages).

This is specifically tailor made to bash in Windows 10 (Ubuntu). Though the exercises should work in all Linux distributions.
